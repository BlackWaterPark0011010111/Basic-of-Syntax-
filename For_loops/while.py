"""The while loop
In this exercise, we will focus on the usage of the while loop, including:

input() from the user,
range() function,
in keyword.
Tasks
âž• Task 1 - omitting number
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop to print out numbers from -5 to 5, without 0. You can't use break and continue statements!
Your results should look similar to this: -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 1 2 3 4 5

âž• Task 2 - Upper and lower letters
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop, that iterates over given string and converts the lower letters to capital letters and vice versa.
Print it out after changes.
Hint: use string's methods and be careful of long texts and new lines!
Note: You can use any text, for example from lyrics. My was:"Overhead the albatross Hangs motionless upon the air And deep beneath the rolling waves In labyrinths of coral caves" ðŸ˜ƒ

Your results should look like this:oVERHEAD THE ALBATROSS hANGS MOTIONLESS UPON THE AIR aND DEEP BENEATH THE ROLLING WAVES iN LABYRINTHS OF CORAL CAVES

âž• Task 3 - average of numbers
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop, to calculate the average of n integer numbers (input from the user). Input 0 (zero) finishes entering numbers and prints out calculations.
Hint: Average of n numbers is their sum divided by n,
for example average of numbers 5, 7 and 12 is (5 + 7 + 12)/3 = 24/3 = 8.
Your results should look like this:
Input few integers to calculate their average!
Input 0 to exit!!!
Type a integer: 5
Type a integer: 7
Type a integer: 12
Type a integer: 0
Average of the above numbers is:  8.0
âž• Task 4 - find a character
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop, to find indexes of prompted character in the given text.

Note: Program should be case-sensitive, what means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct!
Hint: use string's methods and be careful of long texts and new lines!
Note: You can use any text, for example from lyrics. My was:
"She came to me one morning One lonely Sunday morning Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind I know not how she found me For in darkness I was walking And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win"
Your results should look like this:
Text:
She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win
What should be found?: S
Character S found at index 1
Character S found at index 39

âž• Task 5 - find divisible numbers
Your task is to write a Python program using while loop, read (prompt) three numbers (a,b,c) and check how many numbers between a and b are divisible by c.
Input 0 (zero) as a third number (divisor) finishes program and prints out the results.Your results should look like this:
Type starting integer: 1
Type ending integer: 100
Type divisor: 15
15  is divisible by 15
30  is divisible by 15
45  is divisible by 15
60  is divisible by 15
75  is divisible by 15
90  is divisible by 15
Type starting integer: 5
Type ending integer: 8
Type divisor: 0"""
